### 📚 Learning Objectives

This project helped me learn:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like classes, objects, and encapsulation.
* Basic file handling (if implemented).
* Modular code design and maintainability.
* Using Git for version control and collaboration.

---

### 🎯 Future Enhancements

* Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
* Add user authentication (login/logout).
* Integrate a database for persistent storage.
* Generate rental receipts.
